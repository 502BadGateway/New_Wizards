#Ive recreated this file because the original main file was straight from project 2.
#No attempt to clean up, add new functionality or adapt current has been made. 
#Importing modules we arnt using, and using stuff we agreed not to use.
#After going through it, its quicker to c/p back in stuff we need, rather than modify it.
#Since its quicker to write code than to read it.
