"""

Ive recreated this file because the original main file was straight from project 2.
No attempt to clean up, add new functionality or adapt current has been made. 
Importing modules we arnt using, and using stuff we agreed not to use.
After going through it, its quicker to c/p back in stuff we need, rather than modify it.
Since its quicker to write code than to read it.
