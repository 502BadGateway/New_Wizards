ALL Project Group C1 - 502:Bad Gateway

To run our Software, please download and run the main.py file. 

This will allow you to pick which city you want the arena to be based on, which treasures you want to collect, and what sorting algorithm you would like to sort the collected treasures with.

We currently have all of our project completed, but it is not all connected into main.py.

All of Dans code is stored within our testSort file, this is a prototype for the actual implimentation. If the main.py doesn't run a sorting algorithm, run testSort.py and you will see it work!
